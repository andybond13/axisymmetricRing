Notes:

todo:
-continue parallelizing list (starting at checkstable)
-collect & add up energies in newmark routines
-compile all results at end?? or at end of each time-step?


future improvements:
-parallelize (by domain)
-use true stress (find area via inclusion of poisson's ratio)
-explore log-strain
