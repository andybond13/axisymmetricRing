Notes:

todo:
-solve difference between np1 & np4
-compile all results; parallelize graphs/datafiles


future improvements:
-add unit tests for np1 vs np4
-consider using boost vectors to simplify code (you can do operations on them)
-use true stress (find area via inclusion of poisson's ratio)
-explore log-strain
